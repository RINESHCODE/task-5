 Decision Trees & Random Forests â€“ Heart Disease Dataset
This project demonstrates tree-based models for classification using the Heart Disease dataset.
It covers training and visualizing decision trees, tuning tree depth to prevent overfitting, building a random forest, and interpreting feature importances.

Features
Decision Tree Classifier with visualization

Overfitting analysis using max_depth

Random Forest training and accuracy comparison

Feature importance analysis

Cross-validation for performance evaluation

Technologies Used Python:
      Pandas, NumPy
      Scikit-learn
      Matplotlib, Seaborn
